# discordpy-BibleBot2
Made for printing the bible in discord lol
if you wanna do the bible you are gonna have to fine your own bible to use for this


once you get the bot up and running you just type
'start [file name]
in a discord chat and it will start printing lines from that file and the file has to be in the same directory as the actual python script because idgaf
